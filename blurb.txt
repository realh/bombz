Bombz is a simple 2D puzzle game. It doesn't really have a plot. The object is to blow up all the bombs on each level then escape off the edge of the screen. To blow up a bomb, push it to where you want to cause an explosion, then collect a match and touch the bomb again and quickly get out of the way. A bomb destroys everything surrounding it except the metallic walls; if it blows up another bomb, that takes out everything around it too so you can set off chain reactions.

Version 0.3.0 features keyboard controls. You can use the arrow keys, WASD or ZXL, (comma). I hope to provide an option to turn off the on-screen controls soon, but it will take longer because I need to redesign the config screen. To upgrade from 0.2.0 you will have to uninstall the old version first because I lost my APK signing key. Sorry! I'm as annoyed with myself as you are. 

Please remember this is a free game. It lacks in-game help and some polished transition screens etc.

It's a port of my PC game Bombz, hosted at <http://bombz.sourceforge.net>. Note that the levels in the Android version are in a different order from the PC version because I've tried to rearrange them in a better order of difficulty, based on arbitrary statistics.
